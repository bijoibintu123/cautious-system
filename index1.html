    <h1>2. How the Internet Works: The Internet is an incredible network of interconnected servers and computers that direct web browser requests through a network of wired and wireless connections.

        While that’s a vague explanation, the fact is that the Internet has gotten so large and complex that it’s a challenge to be any more specific about it!
        So why is this important for students to understand?

        The Internet is so fast and responsive that it’s almost mind-blowing to consider all of the processes that have to happen behind the scenes just for someone to check their email.
        
        But only a small percentage of people in the world — including students — actually understand what those processes are.
        
        Even fewer understand how those processes work!
        
        When you show students that the Internet works via a sophisticated interconnection of digital tools, you set the stage to help them understand the next key elements of digital citizenship as well.
        3. Understanding User Data: User data is one of the most complex and concerning concepts in the digital age.

        Just about every company with a website collects data on the people who visit it. That data may be as simple as the pages that someone views, and it could be as complex as someone’s home address.
        
        Most of the websites on the Internet use this information for marketing purposes. It helps them understand their customers a little bit better, and it helps companies connect with people in a meaningful way.
        
        However, other websites use this opportunity maliciously. They may “mine” someone’s web browser for their search history. They might also attach a “cookie,” or unique identifier, to someone’s web browser to see the other websites they visit. 
        
        Then, many of these companies take this data, package it together, and sell it to the highest bidder.
        
        While almost every country has laws dictating that companies can’t collect data on individuals younger than 18 (or 13 in some places), the fact of the matter is that it happens anyway.
        
        As a result, your students need to know about personal data — and they need to know how they can protect themselves!
        4. Practicing Digital Literacy: Digital literacy is the practice of reading information online and understanding what it means, where it originated, and whether it’s accurate.

        As a result, digital literacy is one of the hardest concepts to teach to students. It’s also one of the most important qualities for students to become good digital citizens!
        
        After all, how can they practice good digital citizenship if they can’t discern accurate information from misinformation online?
        
        Digital literacy also includes learning about ethics, protecting yourself online, and even preventing cyberbullying.
        
        It’s a lot to pack into a single subject — but it’s essential for students in 21st Century classrooms.
        5. Acknowledging the Digital Divide: The digital divide is the disparity between those who have access to modern digital tools (like computers and the Internet) and those who don’t.

        This is important to recognize because the Internet is still very much a luxury in the world, even in the United States!
        
        Access to computers and the Internet is still restricted by finance in every part of the world, meaning that those in poverty don’t have the same level of access as those who have disposable income.
        
        While Americans may think that this mostly applies to individuals living in third-world countries, the truth is far grimmer.
        
        Only 75.23% of Americans have Internet access, with a full 24.77% living without access.
        
        In addition, 20% of Americans live in the Midwest where Internet access is most scarce, meaning that the infrastructure exists for a fair amount of Americans in that 24.77% who don’t use the Internet.
        
        Unfortunately, that means the remaining Americans in that percentage simply can’t afford Internet access.
        
        Some schools will have a disproportionately high quantity of those students. Others may have none at all. 
        
        But if your students aren’t aware of the digital divide, then they may end up assuming that all students have equal access to the Internet — which is patently false.
        
        At the same time, you don’t want to ask students who don’t have home Internet access to identify themselves to illustrate this point. That’s embarrassing, and it could end up having a negative impact on your classroom.
        
        So how can you introduce students to such a strange topic without isolating students in your class?
        6. Practicing Digital Wellness: Digital wellness is the practice of refraining from indulging in the Internet and digital media for unreasonable amounts of time.

In other words, it’s the practice of knowing when to “take a break” from screens.

Digital wellness is important because too much screen time can have adverse effects on students.

Adrian F. Ward of the University of Colorado performed a full study on this topic and discovered that screen time can impact transactive memory, empathy, and even grey matter development in young minds.

So, strangely enough, the best way to practice digital wellness is to leave digital devices for a few hours every day!
